TEXTILE (Tutorials for EXperimenTalist Interactive LEarning) in Data Science
=======

![Logo](/images/logo.png)

This TEXTILE curriculum teaches trainees data science from the biological
perspective of brain cell shape quantification.

What is TEXTILE?
===========

In the Disease Directed Engineering Lab (nancelab.com), we develop tools to
inform how we can more effectively treat the diseased brain. In our lab, we take
a lot of cool immunofluorescent images of brain cells. To better analyze those
cells, we developed a data science pipeline for cell segmentation and
quantification. To train others within and outside of our lab to use our cell
quantification pipeline, we developed TEXTILE!

This is the home repository for our first TEXTILE course from Summer 2020.

TEXTILE Curriculum
===========

TEXTILE is a semi-linear, module-based learning system!

What does that mean?

/_semi-linear_/ We have three linear pathways to follow along with:

1. **Research Lab Specific** (purple, top row): Motivates the greater TEXTILE
work within the context of the Disease Directed Engineering Lab.
2. **Data Science Specific** (green, middle row): The data science fundamentals
needed to support the end learning goal of image processing and train students
on data management for experimentalists.
3. **Image Processing Specific** (blue, bottom row): The cell segmentation and
quantification lessons

Based on the personal preference and previous experience of the trainee, the
three pathways can be followed independently or together. Additionally, based on
students' previous experience, the curriculum can begin at any point on the
linear pathway. For example, if the student is familiar with data science but
not image processing, they can learn only the image processing specific pathway
and skip the data science specific pathway.

/_module-based_/ Every lesson is a module with three parts:
1. **pre-module**: A primer to get you thinking about the main lesson
2. **main module**: The main educational lesson
3. **post-module**: A reflection exercise with opportunities to explore more
independently.
