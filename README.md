Tutorials and Modules for teaching experimentalists data science from a
biological perspective.

What is TEXTILE?
===========

As a lab filled with mainly experimentalists, the Nance Lab uses data science
to enhance our abilities. Because of this, we needed a effective way to train
our experimentalists in how to use Data Science methods and tools that are most
applicable to our work. So we started our TEXTILE program! This is the home
repository for our TEXTILE in Data Science modules :)

Specifically, we have created approachable and accessible modules to teach Data
Science from a Biological perspective.
