This TEXTILE curriculum teaches trainees data science from the biological
perspective of brain cell shape quantification.

What is TEXTILE?
===========

In the Disease Directed Engineering Lab (nancelab.com), we develop tools to
inform how we can more effectively treat the diseased brain. In our lab, we take
a lot of cool immunofluorescent images of brain cells. To better analyze those
cells, we developed a data science pipeline for cell segmentation and
quantification. To train others within and outside of our lab to use our cell
quantification pipeline, we developed TEXTILE!

This is the home repository for our first TEXTILE course from Summer 2020.
