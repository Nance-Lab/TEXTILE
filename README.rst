TEXTILE (Tutorials for EXperimenTalist Interactive LEarning) in Data Science
=======

Tutorials and Modules for teaching experimentalists data science from a
biological perspective.



Description
===========

As a lab filled with mainly experimentalists, the Nance Lab uses data science
to enhance our abilities. Because of this, we needed a way to train our
experimentalists in how to use Data Science methods and tools that are most
applicable to our work. So we started our TEXTILE program! This is our TEXTILE
in

Specifically, we have created approachable and accessible modules to teach Data
Science from a Biological perspective.
